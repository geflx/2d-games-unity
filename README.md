# Ninja Run - Android 2D Game :video_game::running:

Ninja Run is a 2D endless running game and it was my first theme choice to learn about game development in Unity. 
I had a lot of fun implementing and testing this game, and received a great feedback from users.
The main objective is to survive the maximum shuriken/attacks waves possible, using jump button to scape and survive them.

PS: Characters's sprites are from Naruto fans (http://www.narutohq.com/sprites.php).
