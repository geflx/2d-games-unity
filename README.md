# Ninja Run - Android 2D Game :video_game::running:

Ninja Run is a 2D endless runner game and it was my first theme choice to learn about game development in Unity.    

The **main objective** is to survive the maximum shuriken/attacks waves possible, using **jump button**(clicking at the mid-upper screen space) to scape and survive them.  
I had a lot of fun developing and testing this game, and hope you will have fun playing it. For the record, the **known highscore** is 990 points.  

PS: Characters's sprites are from Naruto fans (http://www.narutohq.com/sprites.php).
